# Customer Churn Analysis and Risk Management

This repository contains a **Power BI project** designed to analyze customer churn and identify at-risk customers. The project provides actionable insights for improving customer retention and business outcomes.

## Project Overview

The project includes two interactive dashboards:

### 1. Churn Dashboard
- **Demographics**: Customer profiles, including age, gender, and seniority.
- **Customer Account Information**: Metrics like tenure, contract types, and payment methods.
- **Services**: Analysis of internet service types (e.g., Fiber Optic, DSL) and their influence on churn.

### 2. Customer Risk Analysis Dashboard
- **Risk Identification**: Highlights customers at high risk of churning based on factors such as short tenure, high monthly charges, and lack of bundled services.
- **Impact Analysis**: Evaluates how contract types (month-to-month vs. 1- or 2-year contracts) and payment methods (automatic vs. manual) affect churn likelihood.

## Key Objectives

1. **Enhancing Customer Support Efficiency**  
   - Reduce tech tickets per customer to 0.5.

2. **Driving Contract Retention**  
   - Increase 1- and 2-year contract sales by 5%.

3. **Boosting Automation for Billing**  
   - Achieve a 5% yearly increase in automatic payments.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Easy-to-navigate dashboards built with Power BI.
- **Data Insights**: Actionable metrics for retention strategies.
- **Customization**: Tailored filters for deep-dive analyses.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a customer churn dataset with the following key attributes:
- **Customer Demographics**: Gender, seniority, etc.
- **Account Information**: Tenure, contract type, payment method.
- **Service Details**: Internet service type, streaming services.
- **Churn Status**: Whether the customer has churned or not.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI**: For creating dashboards and data visualization.
- **Python**: For data preprocessing and analysis (optional).
- **Excel**: For raw data storage and initial exploration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Power BI Desktop installed on your system.
- Access to the customer churn dataset (included in the repository).

### Steps to Recreate the Dashboards
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/churn-analysis.git
   ```
2. Open the Power BI project file (`ChurnAnalysis.pbix`) in Power BI Desktop.
3. Load the dataset (`churn-dataset.xlsx`).
4. Explore the dashboards to gain insights into churn patterns and risk analysis.

## Future Enhancements
- Add predictive analytics using machine learning models.
- Integrate live data sources for real-time analysis.
